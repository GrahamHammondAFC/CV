        <p>
          My ambition is to work alongside motivated and enthusiastic individuals, who have a passion to learn and grow in collaborative teams, to play a pivotal role in bringing team members together to deliver projects that are challenging, highly
          satisfying and done so with a level of service that meets and ideally exceeds the expectations. As a digital professional with over 20 years’ experience of project management and delivery, my focus is to deliver engaging and high-quality
          products that continue to grow and add value for the stakeholders, markets and users. I am a team player, an objective thinker and have an eye for detail for challenging people to consider solutions beyond their understanding of a standard
          approach, while following best practice to adhere to project boundaries and business targets
